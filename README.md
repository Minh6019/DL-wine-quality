#### Datasets: 
   - wine.csv. Contains data recordings of the wine.
#### Number of Instances
   - Red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898.
### Attribute information:
   For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].
   
   -Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1 - fixed acidity
   2 - volatile acidity
   3 - citric acid
   4 - residual sugar
   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates
   11 - alcohol
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

### Method
Below are provided the steps that were followed for this project.
My objectifs are to concentralize on the maximize on the tuning of differents parameters and functions of the Keras model to have the optimum one.

 1. Data visualization: ploting data to detect missing values, data relations and usefulness of features

 2. Preprocessing: apply preprocessing of data including dealing with missing values, drop unuseful features and build new features
    - Build Features and Target: 
         - Feature selection: see above
         - Target: 'type' of the wine {1: red, 0: white}

 3. Classifier: build model classifiers **{1: red wine, 0: white wine}** based on Neural Network (Keras)

   - Hyper-parameter tuning:

  - Modify the architecture
      - Number of layers

      - Number of neurons per layer

      - Activation functions
