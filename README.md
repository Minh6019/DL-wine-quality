### Method
Below are provided the steps that were followed for this project. Each step and classifiers have their own document.

 1. Data visualization: ploting data to detect missing values, data relations and usefulness of features

 3. Preprocessing: apply preprocessing of data including dealing with missing values, drop unuseful features and build new features
    - Build Features and Target: 
         - Feature selection: see above
         - Target: 'type' of the wine {1: red, 0: white}

 4. Classifier: build model classifiers **{1: red wine, 0: white wine}** based on Neural Network (Keras)
   - Use Keras to design the Neuron Network:

   - Hyper-parameter tuning:

  - Modify the architecture
      - Number of layers

      - Number of neurons per layer
